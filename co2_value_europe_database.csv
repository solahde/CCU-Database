Solvent-based carbon capture is an important technology that can be readily adopted to many emission sources. Such technology can achieve high capture rates and deliver CO2 at high purity with a relatively low energy demand. In AURORA the open and non-proprietary CESAR1 solvent technology will be optimised and qualified for commercial deployment. The technology will be demonstrated at TRL7-8 for three CO2 intensive industries:  refining, cement, and materials recycling, for which there are few other options to achieve climate neutrality. The partners will demonstrate negligible environmental impact (emissions being a potential issue for solvent technology), capture rates at 98%, and capture costs reduced by at least 47% compared to a benchmark process with the MEA solvent. This will be achieved due to the following innovations: 1) Holistic optimisation of solvent composition, process design, emission monitoring and control, and solvent management, 2) Validated models for use in commercial process simulators 3) enhanced waste heat integration with carbon capture for reduced external heat demand and operational costs 4) Improved and integrated advanced control system for reduced OPEX and optimised performances. These innovations will be integrated in four optimised capture processes and various aspects will be demonstrated in pilots of various size and complexity. The partners will ensure transferability of results to other CO2 intensive industries thanks to the large variations in CO2 source and developed clusters addressed in the project and  a strong stakeholder participation. The project will also do full CCUS chain assessments for its end-users. It is noteworthy that the end-users are situated in two different regions of Europe offering different conditions for the implementation of CCUS value chains.

• Sharing knowledge and disseminating information important for stakeholders to make informed decisions on CCUS
• Developing specific and actionable plans for the development of CCUS value chains

developments as best practice for the development of new CCUS value chains in the currently underdeveloped Baltic
Sea (BS) and the Mediterranean Sea (MS) Regions. While CCUS value chains, i.e., the entire pathway from CO2 capture
to transport to its eventual storage or utilization, can today be realized, the industry is still in its infancy and many issues
must be addressed to achieve the rapid deployment required. The consortium, consisting of 15 partners, including 2
associations with over 400 members in total, brings together entities with leading expertise on all aspects of CCUS value
chains. 30 organisations, representing industry, RTOs, Associations, clusters, ports and municipalities involved in the
development and deployment of CCUS value chains, will contribute their expertise as networking partners.
Starting from an analysis of the technical and non-technical state-of-play in the BS and MS regions, CCUS ZEN will
select at least eight value chains (four in each region) for detailed study and comparison with successful value chains
from the NS region. One value chain from each analysed region will then be selected as most promising, with a detailed
plan for further development. Through its knowledge-sharing activities and transfer of best practices from the NS region,
CCUS ZEN will provide an information basis for the future CCUS value chains, including policy recommendations
and a blueprint for CCUS value chain development, including easily accessible technology and CO2 source mapping,

A detailed full system model will be implemented, considering the biogas feedstock, composition fluctuations (and dilution) and pollutant signatures, and optimizing thermal integration with biogas-inherent CO2 (for dry-dominant reforming) and digester heating, with the targets to maximise net electrical efficiency and minimise cost.

The hydrogen will then be used to produce climate-friendly fuels for aircraft as well as fed into gas grids. In fuel production without fossil fuels, unavoidable CO2 from regional cement production is used for the production process. What is special and innovative about this real-world laboratory project is the interlocking of different material cycles within an already existing regional infrastructure. The project is closely linked to the Carbon2Business project led by Holcim and recently funded by the Innovation Fund for the production of synthetic methanol from CO2 emissions from oxy-combustion in a cement plant. It is also closely linked to the HySCALE100 project with the IPCEI Status that aims at developing off-shore wind-supplied electrolytic capacity of 500 MW and 2GW (post 2026) in the Heide Region.

This is based on the positive outcome of a feasibility study for such a plant that was conducted earlier. The demonstration plant will be powered by regionally sourced renewable energy and combines several innovative technologies: a direct air capture plant provides CO₂ to a highly efficient co-electrolysis unit, that turns the CO₂ and added water into syngas. The syngas is transformed into liquid hydrocarbons by a modular Fischer-Tropsch reactor and then refined into sustainable aviation fuel.
