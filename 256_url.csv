"The main goal of the present joint exchange programme is to determine the feasibility of using sunlight transformation capacity of microalgae to enhance biogas production of anaerobic digestion processes, by means of CO2 capture from biogas and co-digestion of waste and microalgal biomass.  Microalgae biomass produced can be fed to an anaerobic bioreactor, where it is converted to biogas. Subsequently, biogas can be used for energy production. CO2 released can be used for microalgae production, as well as the nutrients released during the anaerobic conversion of the microalgae. Such cycle would be actually driven by sunlight, which provides the energy required to sustain the cycle.

"The overall aim of the project is to develop concepts of the indirectly heated carbonate looping (IHCaL) process for CO2 capture from lime and cement plants. In the carbonator, the CO2 contained in a flue gas is absorbed by CaO, and the CaCO3 formed herby is regenerated in an indirectly heated calciner. The heat for calcination is produced by combustion of fuel with air in an external combustor and transferred to the calciner by means of heat pipes. The flue gas of the external combustor is directed to the carbonator.

"Rapid up-scaling and deployment of more cost-efficient and sustainable carbon capture solutions is needed to reduce the emissions of CO2-intensive industries. Solvent-based carbon capture is an important technology that can be readily adopted to many emission sources. Such technology can achieve high capture rates and deliver CO2 at high purity with a relatively low energy demand. In AURORA the open and non-proprietary CESAR1 solvent technology will be optimised and qualified for commercial deployment. The technology will be demonstrated at TRL7-8 for three CO2 intensive industries:  refining, cement, and materials recycling, for which there are few other options to achieve climate neutrality. The partners will demonstrate negligible environmental impact (emissions being a potential issue for solvent technology), capture rates at 98%, and capture costs reduced by at least 47% compared to a benchmark process with the MEA solvent. This will be achieved due to the following innovations: 1) Holistic optimisation of solvent composition, process design, emission monitoring and control, and solvent management, 2) Validated models for use in commercial process simulators 3) enhanced waste heat integration with carbon capture for reduced external heat demand and operational costs 4) Improved and integrated advanced control system for reduced OPEX and optimised performances. These innovations will be integrated in four optimised capture processes and various aspects will be demonstrated in pilots of various size and complexity. The partners will ensure transferability of results to other CO2 intensive industries thanks to the large variations in CO2 source and developed clusters addressed in the project and  a strong stakeholder participation. The project will also do full CCUS chain assessments for its end-users. It is noteworthy that the end-users are situated in two different regions of Europe offering different conditions for the implementation of CCUS value chains.

"The BioWALK4Biofuels Project (B4B) aimed to develop an alternative and innovative system for the treatment of biowaste and to use GHG emissions to produce second generation biofuels, using macroalgae as a catalyser, in a multidisciplinary approach. The project, seeking for a synergy between biowaste and macroalgae for a clean biogas production, allows to by-pass the high nitrogen content problem of biowaste: in fact macroalgae, needing nitrogen and phosphate to grow, represent an optimal interface, capable to transform the negative eutrophication potential of such a biowaste in a benefit, in terms of increasing algae growth-rate. In the project demonstration area (Augusta Bay, Sicily, Italy) an algae cultivation system was realized together with a biogas production plant. In addition, the relationship between growth and energy potential of selected species with the amounts/characteristic of GHG emissions and biowaste introduced in the cultivation medium is to be studied.

"C3-Mobility aims to show promising ways of CO2-neutral mobility of the future in a closed-loop-cycle. To this end, the long-term motor use of methanol-based fuels, both as pure fuel and as blend, is considered. The final result is a holistic evaluation of the individual fuels with regard to environmental compatibility in production and consumption chains, efficiency as well as sales and market launch. In addition, approaches are being identified to reduce CO2 fleet emissions in the short term. It is examined, which efficiencies Well-to-Wheel are to be reached already today. Methanol-to-Gasoline and 2-butanol are used as blend fuels for the gasoline engine analysis. 1-octanol and oxymethylene ether (OME) are investigated as admixtures for diesel engines.  Methanol is the basis of all fuels examined in the C3 mobility project.

These pilots will investigate the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate CO2 sources: flue gases from modern and future steel-making processes as well as emissions from modern cement plants that use limestone and from waste-to-energy and biothermal power plants. The data collected will be used to create modelling tools to enable commercial scale reactors. Innovative calcium looping solutions will be developed and tested to reach over 99 % CO2 capture rates

"C2B's process is a novel microbially-mediated process and is based on the ability of Oakbio’s proprietary microbial strain to use CO2 from any flue gas and hydrogen (H2) as a feedstock to produce n-butanol, a valuable drop-in biofuel and chemical. In fact, n-butanol is primarily used to make durable acrylic plastics, but is also a superior biofuel, which addresses a massive market as a potential gasoline replacement. Oakbio’s microbial strain grows in a standard fermenter that can be located next to the flue stack of the factories and can capture flue gas directly at the point source with minimal retrofitting.

"Its objective is to create a cross sectorial value chain and to operate a full-scale plant that uses CO2 as a resource by 2030. This plant will eventually capture almost 100% of the annually emitted 700,000 tonnes of CO2 at Lafarge’s cement plant in Mannersdorf, Austria. The aim is to ultimately use the captured CO2 In combination with green hydrogen (from renewable energies) produced by Verbund. OMV will then transform the CO2 to hydrocarbons using renewable energy, which in turn, can be used to produce renewable based fuels or be utilised by Borealis as a feedstock to manufacture value-add plastics.

"The objective is to demonstrate the potential of reduction of GHG emissions in the steel sector by 30+%, by implementing a cost efficient breakthrough solution for the separation of CO2&CO unavoidably emitted. This will be achieved by processing in a pilot line carbon rich gases into 2 streams, one rich in CO and another one in CO2 that could be valorised into promising chemical building blocks in the future. We will also take into account the reuse of any by-products to further induce fossil fuels’ replacement and GHG emissions reductions. Two valorisation routes will be studied during the project, i.e. ethanol as a drop-in transportation fuel and synthetic naphtha as a drop-in chemical building block.

"Aim of the ""catch4climate"" project is to create the basis for a large-scale CO2 capture -applications in cement plants enabling the later use of CO2 as a raw material in other processes (CCU, CCS). For this, four cement manufacturers have joined forces. At the site of the Mergelstetten cement, the consortium intends to build and operate its own demonstration plant on a semi-industrial scale, where the so-called oxyfuel process will be applied for CO2 capture. The aim is to capture almost 100 percent of the CO2 emissions from a cement plant in a cost-efficient manner. In the future, the captured CO2 will be used to produce so-called “reFuels”, which are climate-neutral synthetic fuels such as kerosene for air traffic, with the help of renewable electrical energy.

"The overarching goal of CCUS ZEN is the accelerated deployment of CCUS throughout Europe, which will be achieved
by:
• Sharing knowledge and disseminating information important for stakeholders to make informed decisions on CCUS
• Developing specific and actionable plans for the development of CCUS value chains
As CCUS developments around the North Sea (NS) region are relatively mature, CCUS ZEN will leverage these
developments as best practice for the development of new CCUS value chains in the currently underdeveloped Baltic
Sea (BS) and the Mediterranean Sea (MS) Regions. While CCUS value chains, i.e., the entire pathway from CO2 capture
to transport to its eventual storage or utilization, can today be realized, the industry is still in its infancy and many issues
must be addressed to achieve the rapid deployment required. The consortium, consisting of 15 partners, including 2
associations with over 400 members in total, brings together entities with leading expertise on all aspects of CCUS value
chains. 30 organisations, representing industry, RTOs, Associations, clusters, ports and municipalities involved in the
development and deployment of CCUS value chains, will contribute their expertise as networking partners.
Starting from an analysis of the technical and non-technical state-of-play in the BS and MS regions, CCUS ZEN will
select at least eight value chains (four in each region) for detailed study and comparison with successful value chains
from the NS region. One value chain from each analysed region will then be selected as most promising, with a detailed
plan for further development. Through its knowledge-sharing activities and transfer of best practices from the NS region,
CCUS ZEN will provide an information basis for the future CCUS value chains, including policy recommendations
and a blueprint for CCUS value chain development, including easily accessible technology and CO2 source mapping,
generic technical frameworks and business plan models.

"The production of solar energy helps us reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and thus mitigate global warming by lowering the emission of greenhouse gases. The EU-funded CONDOR project is addressing both of these challenges. It will develop a modular device for the production of fuels by using water and CO2 as feedstock and sunlight as the only energy source. The proposed modular approach will allow for different configurations depending on the target product. The oxidation process is not limited to O2 production, it entails chlorine and small organic molecules, such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid. Employed materials will be obtained from earth abundant chemical elements through low-energy/low-temperature routes.

"DEPECOR: Direct efficient photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction.  The project “DEPECOR” is aiming for the reduction of the CO2 concentration released into the atmosphere by using renewable energy sources for the production of solar fuels. For this purpose, the project partners intend to develop an “artificial leaf” in form of a multi-absorber demonstrator, which has the potential to efficiently reduce CO2 through non-assisted, direct, sunlight-induced photoelectrocatalysis in an integrated system and to convert it into hydrocarbons as storable energy sources.

"UCLA is redesigning the carbon fixation pathways of plants to make them more efficient at capturing the energy in sunlight. Carbon fixation is the key process that plants use to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into higher energy molecules (such as sugars) using energy from the sun. UCLA addresses the inefficiency of the process through an alternative biochemical pathway that uses 50% less energy than the pathway used by all land plants. In addition, instead of producing sugars, UCLA's designer pathway will produce pyruvate, the precursor of choice for a wide variety of liquid fuels.

"The project aims at developing low-cost, scalable technologies allowing carbon dioxide to be used to make a range of useful products. In particular, new processes will be investigated which allow carbon dioxide to function as a monomer in polymer preparation. Using this chemistry, 30-50% of the polymer mass could come directly from carbon dioxide, which also results in a significant reduction in petrochemical usage and greenhouse gas emissions. The process is critically dependent on the selection of the catalyst. Therefore, improved catalysts for the carbon dioxide coPolymerisation are developed here so more sophisticated materials can be developed, particularly targeting higher value, specialty polymer applications.

"The project guides, supports und takes a brokerage function on behalf of the EnCO2re programme. The final objective is to provide practitioners with guidance to compose their business cases. This includes data on the levels of purity of CO2 streams that would be compatible for combination and suitable for particular processes. Other data are the different levels of cost to treat, purify and transport CO2. The results show practitioners the thresholds or tipping points for the viability of different logistics options. This will allow donors and receivers of CO2 to evaluate the benefit and feasibility of common infrastructure in their area.

"CO2 capture and exploitation for the sustainable production of value-added chemicals through 3 microbial factories (lactic acid, acetone and PHA production), integrated within a waste treatment platform. These new microbial factories (MFs) are able to use sunlight and H2 to transform CO2 into chemicals and are modified to increase CO2 capture and conversion ability. The project includes 3 phases: 1) R&D development  i.e. improvement CO2 capture and conversion ability, 2) Development of a new PEM electrolyser for H2 production and integration with MF2 and MF3, 3) Design validation sites, experimental campaign and the feedstocks, services distribution lines deployment and  develop protocols to extract organic substrates from the AD digestate utilized as complementary carbon substrates for the MFs.

"Rotating packed beds (RPBs) have gained increasing attention recently for their potential in process intensification. RPBs rely on centrifugal force to increase the contact of different phases such as liquid-solid or liquid-gas, thus enhancing mass transfer between the two. In the case of post-combustion CO2 capture from flue gases, this also enables a reduction in absorber and desorber sizes. The EU-funded HiRECORD project will demonstrate the high-tech readiness of a modular CO2 capture plant comprising a RPB absorber and advanced RPB desorber with integrated spinning reboiler and advanced, greener solvent. The system will cut CO2 capture costs in half compared to conventional technologies while significantly lowering the environmental and safety impacts.

"The Jupiter 1000 project is the first industrial demonstrator of Power to Gas with a power rating of 1 MWe for electrolysis and a methanation process with carbon capture. Green hydrogen will be produced using two technologies of electrolysers (500kW Alkaline and 500kW PEM)  fed by 100% of renewable energy. The installation will be based on an innovative methanation technology (H2 fed by one electrolyser of 500kW) and CO2 will be captured on a nearby industrial site. In the light of the performance levels shown by the demonstrator, GRTgaz and its partners will work on future technical and economic standards of a full-sized installation of this type. Over the longer term, the idea is to launch the Power to Gas activity in France. Between 20 and 50 TWh of electricity could converted into gas per year could be produced each year using the Power to Gas system by 2050.

The EU-funded LAURELIN project will enable the collaboration and knowledge exchange between eight European and two Japanese partners in the development of disruptive, multifunctional catalyst systems by the improvement of limiting factors: selectivity, yield, and energy requirements. Specifically, the project will enable CO2 hydrogenation to obtain methanol as a renewable fuel, with three new advanced synthesis technologies (magnetic induction, non-thermal plasma induction and microwave technologies). LAURELIN will also foster breakthrough innovation in advanced biofuels and alternative renewable fuels, strengthening European and Japanese technology

"Concrete is a highly durable material and, when used effectively, it helps buildings to be extremely energy efficient. Due to global population growth and increasing urbanisation, demand is set to increase. However, cement production is CO2-intensive (8 % of global CO2 emissions). The majority of these CO2 emissions are released directly and unavoidably from the processing of the raw materials – not from the combustion of fossil fuels. The EU-funded LEILAC2 project is piloting new technology that re-engineers the existing process flows by indirectly heating the limestone. Building on the success of the first LEILAC Horizon 2020 project (capturing around 5 % of a typical cement plant’s process CO2 emissions), this project seeks to scale up to around 20 % of a typical cement plant’s process CO2 emissions in a deployable and scalable module

"Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) that mimic photosynthesis are direct systems for converting sunlight to stored chemical energy and don’t involve unnecessary steps, such as converting sunlight to electricity. Despite their potential, current PECs are very inefficient in absorbing sunlight and mostly incorporate non-abundant or highly toxic elements. To address this problem, the EU-funded LICROX project aims to implement a new PEC that incorporates three complementary light-absorbing elements driving water oxidation and CO2 reduction. The latter consists of a tandem assembly that combines copper nanocatalysts with molecular catalysts made of only abundant elements. The best-in-class compounds will be used for validating several light-trapping mechanisms to enhance PEC's light-harvesting efficiency. The project will pave the way for a new scalable renewable energy technology that efficiently converts sunlight to stored chemical energy.

"With several advantages as a carbon-neutral fuel, methanol is an attractive energy vector that can be produced using only renewable resources. In this context, the EU-funded METHASOL project will create a sustainable and cost-efficient production process that relies on selective visible-light-driven gas-phase CO2 reduction, with a solar energy to methanol conversion efficiency of 5 %. The consortium consists of 14 partners from the EU and Associated Member States (China and the United States), including international researchers on artificial photosynthesis. The project will achieve a pioneering combination of a CO2 reduction reaction system based on a metal-organic framework and a graphitic carbon nitride for photocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions, through a Z-scheme heterojunction.

"Miracles: Multi-product Integrated bioRefinery of Algae-from Carbon dioxide and Light Energy to high-value Specialties.  MIRACLES is an industry driven R&D and innovation project with a multidisciplinary approach aimed at generating robust business cases through technology development. This project addresses the major bottlenecks in microalgae-production:  the lack of available biomass at acceptable costs and the absence of appropriate biorefinery technologies. Therefore, MIRACLES resolve these hurdles by development of integrated, multiple-product biorefinery for valuable specialties from algae for application in food, aquafeeds and non-food products. The focus is on development and integration of mild cell disruption and environmentally friendly extraction and fractionation processes including functionality testing and product formulation based on established industrial strains. The project will also develop new technologies for optimization and monitoring of valuable products in the algal biomass during cultivation and innovative photobioreactor and harvesting technology that will enable substantial cost reduction. A new technology will be developed for CO2 concentration from the air for algal growth and new industrial algae strains for extreme locations will be selected via bioprospecting to expand the resource base for the algae industry and enable cultivation in areas less suitable for agriculture such as deserts.

"Norsk E-Fuel is a consortium that strives to make transportation fuel renewable by producing fuel from CO2 and H2 at cost-competitive proces, suitable for lon-distance transport.  This H2 is 100% produced from renewable energy. Operation in 2023. This will be made possible using a single step co-electrolysis process i.e. the innovative technologies of Sunfire and Climeworks use renewable electricity to convert water and CO2 captured from ambient air and unavoidable CO2 sources into syngas. Renewable fuels, such as jet fuel, are then produced through further processing and refining. The certified end products can be used directly in existing infrastructures.

"Small demonstration plant for the catalytic methanisation of the CO2 content in the biogas by hydrogen generated from steam in a SOEC (Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cells)-plant. Located at the Agricultural Research Centre of Aarhus University.  The feasibility was investigated by means of engineering studies, energy system integration and economic scenario analyses and performance of a few critical experiments with SOEC cells. The outcome endeavoured to provide answers to the following questions: 1) What is the most cost effective upgrading route: Co electrolysis of the CO2 in the biogas with steam followed by methanation or steam electrolysis followed by methanation of CO2 in the biogas? 2) Can the steam reforming activity be controlled by sulphur without sacrificing to much electrochemical activity or lifetime of the cells?

"The use of CO2 to produce fine chemicals and fuels offers an excellent solution to combat global warming and the energy crisis at the same time. Solutions for this problem are searched intensively worldwide. In “PRODIGY”, the partners produce (nano) materials which, as so-called photocatalysts, can convert CO2 into useful products in an environmentally friendly manner using sunlight. This “artificial photosynthesis” is not an easy process, since CO2 is an extremely stable and unreactive molecule. Products of interest are higher-value products, such as lower alcohols, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids.

"Twenty leading industrial and research partners from 11 countries have teamed up to prove that large-scale conversion of industrial carbon emissions into value-added chemicals and materials is possible. As a game changer for European carbon-intensive industries, the EU-funded PYROCO2 project will pave the way for the sustainability of Europe’s chemical industry. It will demonstrate the scalability and economic viability of carbon capture and utilisation to generate climate-positive acetone from industrial CO2 and renewable electricity-derived hydrogen. The project will demonstrate that the acetone produced is an ideal platform for the catalytic synthesis of a range of chemicals, synthetic fuels and recyclable polymer materials from CO2 for viable business cases and pre-developed processes for replication and commercialisation.

"Almost everyone now agrees that we should decrease the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) to mitigate climate change. Reducing CO2 production is not the only way to reduce emissions. Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) refers to an integrated set of technologies to prevent the CO2 produced during the combustion of fossil fuels from entering the atmosphere. Currently, these technologies focus on the greatest sources of CO2 in a process, ignoring smaller ones. The EU-funded REALISE project is developing a way to capture up to 90 % of CO2 from multiple sources in operating refineries at a cost that is 30 % lower than existing capture methods. The project will include the evaluation of the entire CCUS chain from emitter to storage as well as socio-political aspects and social readiness assessments based on three business cases in the EU and China

"Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a process that can convert waste CO2 into chemicals for the chemical industry or into fuels. It is generating growing interest as a way to simultaneously address climate change and energy security. However, significant technological improvements are required to enable the realisation of practical and cost-effective CO2 electrolysis systems. The EU-funded SELECTCO2 project is on a mission to do just that, relying on modelling from the quantum level up to the complete device to gain critical insight into the role of microscopic changes in macroscopic outputs. The team is developing novel catalysts, gas diffusion layers and membranes targeting CO, ethanol and ethylene production. Enhanced selectivity, efficiency and durability should create important market opportunities

"The aim is to engineer novel photoreactors that can achieve intensified, efficient CO2-to-hydrocarbon (solar fuel) photoreduction and separation of unreacted CO2. Existing processes suffer low productivity due to a lack of appropriate reactor designs able to efficiently introduce light, reactants and a suitable photocatalyst into simultaneous contact, and to effect subsequent product separation and recycling of unreacted CO2. Recent progress focused on novel catalysts development through advances in nanotechnology, but CO2 photoreactor design needs a step-change transformation to reach a higher overall process performance.

"The aim of this project is to design, test, and demonstrate an innovative technology, referred to as the Sunexus CO2 Solar Reformer. The Sunexus technology employs a two stage process for the conversion of CO2 to diesel fuel with an overall system energy of 74%, due to the use of concentrated solar energy: First, the solar reformation of captured CO2, methane and steam produces synthesis gas and second, the syngas  is catalytically (Terra) transformed into diesel fuel. Here, the first stage was studied by developing a solar reforming system, including a specially designed reactor and proprietary CO2 reforming catalyst with high conversion efficiencies. The second stage of the system has been demonstrated under other funding.

"An important building block in the chemical industry, ethylene is used to produce numerous materials, such as plastics and detergents. It’s the largest volume organic chemical produced in the world. It’s time to reinvent the ethylene industry, so it is sustainable and technically and economically competitive. In this context, the EU-funded SolDAC project features a photoelectrochemical conversion (PEC) unit, as electrochemistry is the only possible route for direct conversion of CO2 into ethylene. Specifically, the PEC exploits bandwidth-selected light from a solar collector (FSS) that splits the solar spectrum for electricity and heat generation at an efficiency higher than standalone photovoltaic modules and standalone solar thermal collectors. Heat is used in an innovative direct air capture unit that removes CO2 from the air.

"To overcome the problems encountered in aqueous media, CO2 electro-reduction (ERC) is being studied in ionic liquid media. The use of these unconventional media not only makes it possible to solubilize more CO2 than the aqueous medium but also suppresses the competitive reaction of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The present work consists in the study of the reduction reaction of CO2 in different ionic liquids at gold and copper electrodes. The influence of the nature of the ionic liquid on the electrocatalytic performance is examined by the use of RTILs made up of cations of different nature and of the same anion.

"Ethylene is an energy-rich chemical produced from fossil fuels in industry, with high commercial value and a strong presence in the global market. Targeting ethylene as the final product, the EU-funded SUN2CHEM project aims to develop solutions that will result in efficient solar-driven CO2 reduction. To do this, the project will develop all the components to be integrated into tandem photoelectrochemical cells and advanced photocatalytic reactors. It will also conduct environmental and social studies on the new technology in the context of a circular economy, its energy security impacts and the social acceptance of chemicals produced from sunlight conversion. The project will play a role in making us less dependent on fossil fuels and in reducing carbon emissions by CO2 conversion.

SUNRISE aims to develop ways of mimicking natural photosynthesis to produce sustainable fuels and commodity chemicals for renewable energy storage and a clean chemical industry. Among this, nitrogen fixation and the conversion of atmospheric CO2 into products is also included.  ENERGY-X aims to find ways for efficiently converting solar and wind energy into chemical forms. It aims to develop new catalysts as well as novel approaches for converting water, CO2, and N2 into fuels and base chemicals, in particular carbon-neutral aviation fuels and fertilisers. In other words, SUNERGY vision is to enable a circular economy by making fuels, base chemicals for industry and agriculture, and developing negative CO2 emission technologies using resources that are abundant in Europe (renewable energies, CO2 , H2O and N2).

"TAKE-OFF is an industrially driven project that will be a game-changer in the cost effective production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from CO2 and hydrogen. The unique TAKE-OFF technology is based on conversion of industrial captured CO2 and electrolytically produced H2 via ethylene as intermediate.  Due to their strict criteria in terms of physical and chemical properties, the aviation sector is highly limited in the number of options for meeting sustainability goals.

"The pollution produced by the textile industry has severe impact on the planet. Fashion, footwear and household textiles are responsible for water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and landfill. Polyester (PET), a synthetic fibre derived from oil, is the most widely used fibre in the industry. Unfortunately, it is not a sustainable textile option. The EU-funded THREADING-CO2 project will demonstrate, on an industrial scale, a first-of-its-kind technology that converts CO2 waste streams into high-quality, commercially viable, sustainable polyester textiles. The project will use a circular manufacturing approach and run on renewable energy sources to reach a 70 % reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to existing PET manufacturing processes

"The unique innovation in “TRANSFORMATE” is the full integration and optimization of a two-stage process (electrolysis and fermentation) for the direct conversion of CO2 into biopolymers via formic acid. For the first time, a formic acid electrolyzer is coupled to a bioreactor and the interaction of the integrated system will be optimized.  In a first step, CO2 is reduced by electrochemical conversion to formic acid. In a second step, the formic acid is fed into a bioreactor, where formic acid metabolizing microorganisms (formatotrophs) convert the feedstock formic acid into specialty chemicals at very high selectivity.

"The aim of the research project is to use existing gas (pore) reservoirs as natural bio-reactors. The methanation process and storage take place naturally in underground pore reservoirs. To achieve this, green hydrogen (produced from solar or wind power and water) is injected into an existing (porous) natural gas reservoir together with carbon dioxide. Naturally occurring microorganisms will then convert these substances into renewable gas which can be stored in the same reservoir, withdrawn as needed at any time, and transported to consumers via the existing pipeline network.

"In Schleswig-Holstein, the cross-industry partnership “Westküste 100” has formed between EDF Germany, Holcim Germany, OGE, Ørsted, Raffinerie Heide, Stadtwerke Heide, thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions and Thüga — together with the Region Heide development agency and the Westküste University of Applied Science. The hydrogen will then be used to produce climate-friendly fuels for aircraft as well as fed into gas grids. In fuel production without fossil fuels, unavoidable CO2 from regional cement production is used for the production process. What is special and innovative about this real-world laboratory project is the interlocking of different material cycles within an already existing regional infrastructure. The project is closely linked to the Carbon2Business project led by Holcim and recently funded by the Innovation Fund for the production of synthetic methanol from CO2 emissions from oxy-combustion in a cement plant. It is also closely linked to the HySCALE100 project with the IPCEI Status that aims at developing off-shore wind-supplied electrolytic capacity of 500 MW and 2GW (post 2026) in the Heide Region.

"This project further investigates the construction of a demonstration plant producing fully circular SAF with 100% CO₂ derived from the air. This is based on the positive outcome of a feasibility study for such a plant that was conducted earlier. The demonstration plant will be powered by regionally sourced renewable energy and combines several innovative technologies: a direct air capture plant provides CO₂ to a highly efficient co-electrolysis unit, that turns the CO₂ and added water into syngas. The syngas is transformed into liquid hydrocarbons by a modular Fischer-Tropsch reactor and then refined into sustainable aviation fuel.
