    "## What to do better next time:\n",

    "Instead of copypasting all the individual URL's manually to an empty list, automatization would have been better approach.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. I created a code that can read an individual project page from CO2 Value Europe database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I then wanted to automatize this code to read all the pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. But it appeared that the links in the \"Project\" column were embedded within the HTML structure, and they did not have a direct 'href' attribute in the 'a' tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I learned that in such cases, I could use the 'click' event to follow the links and extract the URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. I then learned that web scraping with dynamic content (like clicking links) often requires a tool like 'Selenium', which can automate interactions with a webpage. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. I then installed 'Selenium' to my editor\n",
    "\n",
    "7. I also download the Chrome WebDriver for 'Selenium' according to my Chrome versio which at the time was 117.0.5938.150.\n",
